# Ch20-Solidity

This project utilized the Remix IDE to deploy and test a smart contract with deposit and withdrawal functions. 1, 5, and 10 ether were deposited in wei, and 5 and 10 ether were withdrawn by two separate accounts. Additionally, confirmation functions were called to display the balance, last address that withdrawed, and the last withdrawal amount. The screenshots below show the results of that process.
